## 🧠 Approach

This project uses a component-first design approach to keep the logic modular and UI reusable. Key highlights include:

- `useState()` hooks to manage search terms and modal state
- Filter logic using `.includes()` for real-time search
- Tailwind classes for styling instead of custom CSS
- Conditional rendering for displaying student reports in a modal
